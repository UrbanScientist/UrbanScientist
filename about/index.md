## Forward

This is a collection of my intellectual curiosities. It is through a simple and conscious dedication to being curious that I believe we can come to profound and unique insights. Those personal discoveries through curiosity are not often reflected on a resume, or when describing what you do for a career. Therefore, this is my attempt at conveying what I find fascinating about the world and my systematic attempts at trying to understand it.
